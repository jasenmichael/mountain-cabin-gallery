I just finished taking the "Get Prepared for the Web Development Immersive - Javascript Accelerated" course at [Galvanize Platte](https://www.galvanize.com/denver-platte/campus "Galvanize Platte 1644 Platte St. Denver, Co. 80202") in Denver Colorado.

This is a project I put together as a part of my portfolio for the Galvanize application process.

Traveling back to Texas with my hands full and a busy schedule, feeling pressed to impress to get my Galvanize portfolio submitted. I have completed many "creative projects" over time, but decided to put this simple gallery/article of a project I designed and built.
