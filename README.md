## mountain-cabin-gallery

I just finished taking the "Get Prepared for the Web Development Immersive - Javascript Accelerated" course at [Galvanize Platte](https://www.galvanize.com/denver-platte/campus "Galvanize Platte 1644 Platte St. Denver, Co. 80202") in Denver Colorado.

This is a project I put together as a part of my portfolio for the Galvanize application process.

here is a working [demo](http://jmh-galvanize-portfolio-2.surge.sh/)

this is a simple bootstrap image gallery showing a small cabin I designed and build.

based on the template from [ tutorialzine.com](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/02/freebie-4-bootstrap-galleries)
